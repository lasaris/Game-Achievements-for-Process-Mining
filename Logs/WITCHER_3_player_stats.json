  "review": "A game that brings an eerily human emotional realism to it's fantasy setting of monsters, mages and all types of races.\n\nAlso shines a light on the prejudices spread by humankind and poses the idea that we must act sooner rather than later to look more inwards towards our own actions before judging those we perceive as 'different' than us and subsequently labelling as 'less' than us.\n\nBugs and gameplay aside, this is a story worth telling to as many people as possible. An epic tale that humbles as much as it excites and is sure to leave a lasting mark on any that experience it's greatness.\n\n\n\nThen Cyberpunk happened...\n\n\n...Thank fuck for The Witcher Series.

  "review": "***I unlocked every achievement on both the PS4 and PC.  That should tell you a lot about whether the game is worth purchasing.  It's also the only game I've unlocked every achievement in.***\n\nAs for the game... f*ck... where do I start?\n\nAfter playing the Witcher 1 in 2007  - I then went on to purchase and read the books (fantastic, btw).  From that point on, I was pretty much hooked on the world and story build around Geralt.\n\nImprovements over the PS4 version, graphically, are definitely noticeable - and even though the game is 5+ years old - damn if it doesn't still look good as hell.  It runs very well too - even with everything on ultra running at 1440p - it's smooth as butter.\n\nCombat is so much better than in was in the Witcher 2.  It's much more 'fluid' and feels like Geralt is dancing through packs of mobs without any real effort.  Once you get the 'flow' of how to 'dance' (is what I call it) attack, sign, dodge/roll, sign, attack, etc... you'll fell the same way.  Execution style animations are badass too, esp on the PC.\n\nThe open world of the game is just that.... open world. You wouldn't expect anything less - and it delivers on a large world in the base game - and another area by itself that feels about 40-50% of the originals game size, as the blood and wine expansion.\n\nCollection armor, potion, and decoction diagrams is the \"hunt\" in this game.  In no way are they difficult to obtain - but it'll add probably 30-40 hours to your gameplay if you decide to hunt them all down and craft all 6 major sets.  You really don't have to hunt down anything else if you play through the rest of the game extensively.  You'll eventually find all of the potions and whatnot throughout.\n\nPlaying on deathmarch (hardest difficulty) - could have been a bit more difficult, tbh.  I noticed this on the PS4 version, and hoped it would have been different for PC - but I was mistaken.  The beginning of the game is quite difficult (esp if you don't build your character correctly) - but once you're about level 15 - it becomes much easier (you'll have a full set of witcher armor by then) - by the end of the B&W expansion, you'll be about level 55 - and if you took the time like myself to collect all the armors, weapons, talismans (to slot in armor and weapons), and all of the places of power to maximize your character...  you're literally a God.\n\nThat's until you play back through on New game+ - this I do not plan to do.  \n\nAs for the expansions themselves...  The blood and wine expansion is phenomenal in my opinion.  Heart of stone is incredibly creative (in a design/story aspect) - but it left a lot to be desired, imo.  Still had fun - the first time.  Wasn't really looking forward to it the second time around.\n\nThere are heaps of different endings and outcomes to the game (I beleive there are 7 in the original game, alone).  If you want all of the achievements, you have to play through the expansion twice (or save before the crutial decisions are made).  I like this because it put a little more emphasis on seeing another ending - IE - what's this achievement?  Oh shit, it's for a different ending... let me check it out.  And believe me, the two endings in blood and wine are very different (there could be more endings that's slightly different - there are MANY choices you make during the final sequence).\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who loves RPG's, building out characters, crafting weapons, armor, etc, and that wants to enjoy a good story....\n\nAnd did I mention the graphics?  Even in 2021?  Goddamn they're nice...\n\nMy PC specs are below.  Peace!\n\n\nAsus ROG STRIX Z390-h\ni9 9900k (stock clock speeds)\n64 GB DDR4 @ 3k mhz\n2x Asus Strix RTX 2070 8gb\n2x 512 GB m.2 SSD\n2x 8TB Seagate 7200 RPM NAS drives\n1x 1TB standard SSD\n2x 27\" Dell 1440p monitors",

  "review": "This one is a long time coming. I originally played this when it came out on GoG. Went half-sies on it with a friend, on their account. But they never picked up the DLCs. So, when the game came on sale here, I got it here. Along with the DLCs. Though, I'd finished the base game already. So I decided to hold off on the whole experience for a little while...\n\nNamely, for a grand re-playthrough of the entire series. With Witcher 3 as its capstone. Now I stand, at the end of this long trek, and now I get to review Witcher 3. As all the games that came before it. I shall attempt to do so as shortly as I can.\n\nIn short: Amazing series. Great game. And that is an important distinction.\n\nI feel Witcher 3 does, at times, get a *little* too much credit for the success of the series overall. Witcher 3 does have some downsides. \n\nFor Cons:\nThere are plenty of bugs in the game, well enough that people offended by Cyberpunk's buggyness should probably check their Pikachu face.  Additionally, some elements have been implemented perhaps a bit underneath previous entries. In some ways, Witcher 2's combat feels more rewarding in the end, and Witcher 3's loses the thematic inspiration that the previous games had for something that feels ultra-ergonomic. Once you get the Invuln-Frames character ability, you can focus on your damage however you like, and then its a gear grind to the end. Which ultimately serves to make any shortcomings in the combat feel detached from a thematic base in the character or story, unlike previous games. Not to mention some unrealized potential (which was likely cut content) in supplementary equipment for a Witcher, in place of Unlimited Ammo crossbow.\n\nSo, I've said all of that. There is a reason I stacked all of the cons up in one place at the start of the review?\n\nPretty much everything else is a pro, in one way, shape, or form.\n\nI put a ton of hours into this game in ONE playthrough. It was a complete playthrough, except for Gwent. I did very little Gwent content in this run, due to how much time I put into it on my initial. So, you could get potentially even MORE hours than I did, give or take some idling I did. Witcher 3 is one of the most content-hour rich games out there. Hands down.\n\nIt is also, conversely, one of the most user friendly open-world games out there. It has a great deal of quality-of-life, while also putting plenty of interest in immersion. I think there is a lot of room to grow from this, but Witcher 3 definitely had this in mind from the onset. It probably has the most well-received implementaiton of limited fast-travel out there.\n\nIt is also a highly immersive world and story. Not just from a realism and accuracy perspective. The world brings you in, it feels consistent, and it makes you feel what it is supposed to make you feel. Monsters may become trivial in some sense. Drowners eventually feel mundane, which is probably normal for a witcher. But up to the very end, the game makes an effort to make the supernatural, and the monstrous, really stand out strong. And it's great.\n\nThe characters are the most consistently realized and implemented, perhaps with the exception of Best Pal Zoltan, but that's okay. Zoltan is still great in this game, no doubts about that. The whole cast is phenomenal. And even entirely new characters who just come into the story, like the Baron, or the Oneiromancer, they all have such great characterization. Meeting people and seeing these interactions are always a delight.\n\nGameplay is also fun and approachable. It makes me sad to think how much more there could've been. This game has some of the highest completion ratings I've ever seen, which can only attest to how fun it is to actually play, and finish.\n\nAnd then there's Gwent.\n\nIf I can say nothing else, it is this. This series is an amazing accomplishment, and it stands the test of time as something truly humbling to behold. And Witcher 3 deserves its place as a successful third-installment.",

  "review": "TLDR: The best single player rpg I've played so far. But as nothing is perfect in life, this game also has some flaws.\n\nHonestly, this game is great. The story, the characters, the environment, the lore... Yes, the combat is okay too, but it failed to be the focus for me. I mean, after the first time i played it, i was so hooked on the story and the world that i just went to read the books - and the were great too.\nBut alas, after replaying this game years later (and now with dlc too), the rose tinted glasses dropped from my nose.\nThere are a bunch of minor bugs still in the game, some smaller or bigger annoyances in the gameplay or the story, and now i finally see why it feels so familiar - it gives me the kind of eurojank game feel, of something like gothic or two worlds. Granted, this game is way newer, technically way more advanced and even bigger than those, but it still gives of the kind of vibe. Just the fact that i had to go to .ini files to change some value because the game launched minimised and would stay that way no matter what shows this. Other common open world game problems are also in here - random crashes, getting stuck in the environment, falling trough the world, stretching character textures, levitating objects/npcs, and so on, but they are uncommon enough that it didn't bother me much.\nThe two biggest gripes i have in this game are the inconsistency of enemy difficulty and dialogue/story.\n\nThe first is quite simple. Some creatures are OP, some are \"bullet sponges\", while others feel laughably easy. Just the fact that random ice troll was harder to beat than an ice giant which was the boss of the area feels dumb. Enemies with shields are just timesinks (and why does \"tiring out the shield bearer will make him drop his shield\" never work? not once), and nekkers, wolves, drowners and some others are just like a pest and are easy to deal with, but you need just one unfortunate hit and then you get stunlocked to death. And the level scaling kinda makes me mad - if enemy is higher level, the fight just gets exponentialy harder and if you get over the threshold to red (7lvl or so difference) makes the fight just laughable. I got into a fight with lv20 leshern as a lv13 - 10min later he had half his health and i died in one hit after a bad dodge. Came back as lv15 with the same gear - destroyed it in 30s, and even getting hit took only 1/5 of my health. I kinda get why it's the way it is, but it still makes me mad.\n\nThe other - dialogue inconsistencies and just general mismatch between the story and gameplay.\nThe dialogue is a great thing in this game, but i get fucking anxiety when making some choices because the established - yellow text advances conversation and white gives more information, is true most of the time, but not always, and that \"not always\" just bothers me to no end, making me anxious if i somehow miss something, if i didn't ask for more info, will it wont give me some option later, will choosing to get more info suddenly advance the conversation for some reason and so on. If you made those rules, please keep them, cause it drives me mad. And also the story/gameplay mismatch - just the stupidity of the situations where you're trying to save one person, but in doing so you kill a dozen or so random bandits, or just people in general, or when you go kill some murderer, but just while getting to him you kill 10x more people than the murderer did. Or the sense of urgency you get while on some quests (especially main ones), but then you look at your minimap or use witcher senses and see so much loot everywhere, that the instinct to loot everything (learned from hours of looting while exploring) just comes into conflict with the current situation.\nThese kind of things just break the immersion (at least for me) and overall just makes the experience of the game worse.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I may complain about a lot of things in here, but it comes purely from the place of love, and from wanting for it to be better. This game is amazing and i love it dearly, and it may be a masterpiece for some people, but it is anything but perfect, as nothing in life ever is.",

  "review": "This is easily the best game of 2015 and certainly one of the greatest games of all time. The game takes place in the books written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski; not a necessary read before playing the game, but highly recommended nonetheless; there is much within (as well as within the first two games) that sets the scene for the Witcher 3. This game does a wonderful job of blurring the boundaries of good and evil much like in Sapkowski's written work.\n\nThe game is reasonably faithful to the source material while taking certain liberties in order to ensure the story is able to flow effectively. I believe The Witcher 3 is an epic tale in it's own right and certainly adds much more value to the franchise. Characters are well put together and have plenty of depth (although I have noticed some character designs are recycled). Geralt's character model even has the scars he received over the book series. \n\nThe world of the Witcher 3 is huge, detailed, vibrant and has plenty of nooks and crannies to explore with many items to discover; aside from the main quest there are side-quests, Witcher contracts and treasure hunts. Witcher contracts are essentially a quest in which you're paid to take out a monster, the identity of which will require some detective work to discover. Treasure hunts are as they sound and usually end with Geralt acquiring some armour or weapons. All types of quests are ABUNDANT and usually every side-quest, Witcher contract or treasure hunt takes place in it's own unique location. \n\nThe graphics even at 1080p blew me away in 2015 and I must confess even 6 years later I'm still amazed at the level of detail in this game; especially now that the hardware exists to run it at it's full potential in 1440p. Even the detail in the chainlink on the starter armour is sheer eye-candy. \n\nFrom a mechanical perspective, everything feels pretty good; I recall being confused as to which sword I was supposed to use the first time I played, however I eventually figured out that it was largely automatic, though you have the ability to switch between them if you deem it necessary. Spells, potions, oils and bombs assist in combat; indeed, at higher difficulties they are a necessity. \n\nThe RPG aspect of the game means you can decide upon your own style of gameplay, which draw on the aforementioned assists in order to turn your Geralt into an absolute killing machine. Currently, my Geralt is able to become a sword tornado, wearing the enemy down with a constant barrage of attacks before going in for the kill. I combine this with a decoction that grants him the ability to heal upon dealing damage, allowing him to leech life as as he destroys everything and everyone around him. \nNone of this is strictly necessary if you don't care for it (at least at lower difficulties); I didn't really understand it on my first play-through and still did okay, though I must admit making good use of the system adds much to my experience. \n\nI truly believe this is a game that everyone should at least try. I respect that everyone has different tastes and that not everyone will enjoy it, but it is truly an amazingly well put-together story that culminates in a beautiful finale, in which any of the endings are far more satisfying, in my opinion, than how Sapkowski chose to end his written series in the Lady of the Lake. \n\nIn short, this game is truly a love-letter to the series from the developers at CDPR and I enjoyed every moment of it.",

  "review": "Game is a glorified visual novel. It's not the best game ever made. \n\nMovement control is stiff. Your character frequently gets stopped in places if there's even a minor bump in the way. Open world design is a just a checkbox of things to do.\n \nThe worst part about the core gameplay is the combat itself. Geralt fights like a drunken swordman, there's no way to predict how Geralt swings his sword in each enemy encounter. Sometimes, he dashes right into an enemy to slash them but other times, he doesn't and obviously, his attack misses. There's no consistency to the combat system. \n\nEven the ability tree is at odds with itself. You get the illusion that your playstyle can change accordingly, the further in you get into the game. I played on normal difficulty, after level 10, I pretty much stopped paying attention to what ability I should spend my points in. Obviously, I spent my first 10 level points unlocking abilities that have some functional use in combat, As for the other ablitiles though, all they do is making incremental changes to enemy damage. I got to level 35 before I realized that \"oh yeah, I should probably spend my ability points\". I did that, tested out what the best abilities to use with my playstyle only to find out that there was literally no fucking difference as to how I play the game. I might have dealt more damage? But the difference was so minimal, it really felt like an utter waste of time. \nThe game feels more like an Action-Adventure game with some minor rpg elements rather than a full blown RPG with meaningful abilities and skills. I also want to mention that one of the abilities straight up disable the effectiveness of this one another ability due to their effects overlapping each other. It's minor stuffs like this that makes me think that the Witcher 3 is just a fluke, and the ship that made this game is not as well-oiled as they're thought to be.\n\nThat leaves the writing. It's probably much the only thing that saves this game from being a total waste of time. it's well written. Every character has a sense of urgency to them, you never feel like you're entitled to anyone's time unless you earn it. It's a reminder that the world in the Witcher 3 is harsh place, and the last thing anyone needs is a witcher looking at their business. Your main character, Geralt, has to put up with a lot of asinine craps when doing favors or contracts for NPCs. Because your character is a mutant, you will always feel some sort of racial prejudice from everyone you meet. Even though Geralt is the only one capable of doing some really dangerous tasks that these NPCs want done, nobody is ever grateful.\n\nAs it is right now, the game is 100+ hours long, which is a heavy time commitment, some of which includes putting up with the mediocre open world design and combat. The writing's good, but I don't think 100+ hours is a worthy investment. The overaching storyline is, sadly, really underwhelming. It does not feel like the grand finale to the entire trilogy. In fact, if this is your first Witcher game, you don't miss out on much at all. The story is about Geralt finding his missing surrogate daughter, Ciri, but the story doesn't kick in until after 40 hours in. 40 hours is a long time. I only recommend this game if you're here for the writing, not the story.\n\n6.5/10",

Not really an issue, but a consideration. The other was that actually it's quite dark through the game. Not necessarily because of the settings but more to do with the atmosphere (it rains a lot so far).

It is one of the best RPGs released after 2000.\n\n\n+\nSteam achievements (52, require a single playthrough on the highest difficulty) \nSteam trading cards (3 drops, 6 to make a badge)\nAn amazing story that will take around 30 hours if you rush the main quests and easily over 100 hours if you do everything\nNew Game+\nA lot of different playstyles (caster, bomber maker, light/medium/heavy armor ...)\nSeveral endings (3)\nDecisions matter (not only for the ending but some quests are connected to previous decisions)\nThe soundtrack is spot on\n4 types of quests - main, secondary, contracts, and treasure hunts\nThere is basic customization of your appearance (hair + beard) \nHighly replayable \nCharacters are unforgettable \nGwenth may be the best minigame in any game ever and there are so many ways to play it \nAll main locations feel really unique and different.\nIncredible atmosphere\nThe game runs perfectly and the animations hold up really well\nThere are free DLCs with armors, quests, alternative looks ...\nYou will get a lot of backstory depending on your decisions in Witcher 1 and 2 (it is actually pretty impressive)\nA lot of loot and crafting. I also really appreciate that ingredients and food have no weight \nVisible customization (10 slots - 4 for the horse, 4 as armor, and 2 swords) \nBoth expansion DLCs are pretty amazing\nI appreciate every game with bestiary and glossary\nYou can spend additional 100 hours going through in-game lore (books, glossaries, enemies ...)\nYou will feel like a badass while fighting large enemies and bosses \nA lot of easter eggs, things from Slavic mythology a fairy tales \nAn amazing ending to a trilogy\nThere is a huge attention to detail (e.g. certain characters will die if you don't do an associated quest in time ...)\nRewarding exploration \n\n-\nThere are some known bugs that are never going to get fixed (missing dialogue, unaccessible chests ...)\nThe game crashed on me a few times (about 3 times in 130 hours) and the sound got bugged a few times (mainly if I ended fight too fast)\nFollow quests are a pain - you are slightly faster than most NPCs so you have to stop and run away several times during each quest\nThaler is alive even if he was killed in Witcher 1\nif you sided with Scoia'tael in Witcher 1 or 2 you will be getting a short stick - basically, no character from their side is in the game. Yaevinn is not even mentioned and Iorveth is cut content.\nHit detection while on a boat is just weird. I sunk several times for no reason or I was hitting an object while being quite far from it.\nFlying enemies in narrow spaces (like ledges) can burn in hell. \nGeralt dies from about 4 meters jump. Yup, he can sly anything but gravity. \n\n+/-\nTo fully enjoy the story you need to know the pentalogy (a lot of things are not explained at all or really briefly)\nI am personally not a fan of proximity-based secondary quests",

As soon as the game opens up a bit it just throws dozens and dozens of crap around the map for you to do, and after all of the side quests are out of the way, nests are destroyed, etc., it feels incredibly hard for me to give a damn anymore about continuing. I spent so much time doing random crap that everyone calls \"insane amount of content,\" but all I see is just filler everywhere to pad the run-time. It doesn't matter if the side stories are good, because when there are 100 side stories to one single main quest it makes it really hard to feel motivated at all to give a shit and continue. I am so tired of chores in games and this game is the EPITOME of chores. CHORES EVERYWHERE! I don't understand why people call this a masterpiece, do they just like being busy and looking at pretty things? \n\nTerrible. Geralt is boring with no character, the story doesnt exist until after you have done your chores, and the combat is so unintuitive. I just don't get the popularity in this but to each their own. KOTOR, Final Fantasy, and Jade Empire have great stories. This is just a time-consumer with sex dabbled here and there.\n\nTo top it all off, Assassin's Creed is trying to rip off this game's success, so this game has also completely deleted the old playstyle of AC. The Ezio assassin days are over because they wanted to be more like The Witcher, just throw more crap around the map to keep you busy, and put spongey health-bars on enemies to give a sense of progression with loot. FFS man, what happened to our taste in games?\n\nTerrible not only in the amount of junk it throws at you and calls it \"content,\" but also terrible in the sense that it has now set a standard of how much junk needs to be in games to be considered \"good.\" You guys did this to yourselves.",

  "review": "After playing the game with no rush I feel like writing a review about it\u2019s duty. First of all, I expected much more from it. It\u2019s not that bad but I think it is one of the most over rated games ever. If you are looking for a hard, real RPG, you are not going to like it. They said it\u2019s inspired from Gothic, but it\u2019s more like newer Assassin Creed games. The game had huge potential, but in vain. They could take much more from older similar games and just implement/improve it.\nSome points that I would like to highlight, just to make it easier for you to know what to expect:\n\nThe BAD:\n\u2022\tMOST IMPORTANT: this level thing for enemies must be removed forever from games like this...it really destroys the feeling you should get for the time spent to develop your character. You know what I mean - let a wolf be a wolf and a dragon be a dragon. Not a level 30 wolf to 1-hit you and a level 5 dragon not to touch you\n\u2022\tGame is too easy \u2013 even on hardest difficulty, everything seems overpowered, doesn't really matter what skills you learn, what approach you choose, what gear you go for\n\u2022\tCombat is bad/cluncky \u2013 you can just spam dodge forever, you can eat in-combat, you can pause the game in-combat to repair your gear, apply oils, etc and you have Quen that is also spammable; all these make the combat and game in general way too easy and not challenging\n\u2022\tIt really gets boring at times\n\u2022\tPlants and monsters respawn over and over again \u2013 so most of the resources are just a matter of time, you don\u2019t have to be cautious how you spend them\n\u2022\tNo animations when you pick up plants, loot chests, packages and more, infinite bolts from your crossbow \u2013 in a medieval RPG like this? No thanks. (and many more things like this that will crush your expectations)\n\u2022\tAbsolutely ridiculous fall damage combined with pretty long loading times makes it really frustrating\n\u2022\tA minimap that acts like a radar \u2013 you can see enemies/monsters/plants on it before you actually spot them; only casuals would want it in a game like this\n\u2022\tXP is not balanced for main/secondary quests/killing monsters; you only get some real xp from main quests and a few secondary quests linked to the main; almost 0 xp for killing monsters and other small quests\n\u2022\tThe way skills are designed is awful for most of them. You don\u2019t get new animations, just + percent/points for something. Lots of them are overpowered but in the end it does not really matter because skills are just small perks and it\u2019s not important how you build your character\n\u2022\tExploring is not rewarded enough (about both looting and discovering new places) - the big map feels empty, almost everything is marked on map with a question mark, places are repetitive\n\u2022\tYou can\u2019t run from a fight as you should be able to...your character stops from running and faces the enemy\n\u2022\tGame is just not interactive enough...you can talk only to NPCs that are involved in quests, or to merchants. Even if you save a prisoner, after freeing him it does not interact with you.\n\u2022\tSome other little bugs and glitches that could be ignored but this situation just rise the frustration level.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\u2022\tGraphics are nice and there are some beautiful sights\n\u2022\tMedieval nice atmosphere overall\n\u2022\tMusic is ok but could be better\n\u2022\tMany rpg elements \u2013 unfortunately not so impactful\n\u2022\tVariety of monsters with their weaknesses\n\u2022\tVariety of items and skills (again, they don\u2019t matter that much)\n\u2022\tNice inventory \u2013 many don\u2019t like it but I find it pretty convenient (bonus: horse items)\n\u2022\tGwent \u2013 a very nice minigame that I enjoyed\n\u2022\tPretty well optimised\n\nVerdict? Way below my expectations. You may buy this game on sale, there is a good chance you will like it if you are a casual. If you want a real RPG like Gothic, Risen, you will find it boring. Don\u2019t pay full price regardless. For debates/questions I leave the comment section opened.",

I remember when Skyrim was over I wanted to replay it again and again for the first time.\n\n[b]Advice about buying the game! [/b]\n-Make sure you buy the Game of the Year Edition with all the DLCS!\nIf you are not sure about your computer's ability to handle the game, you can post your computer specs on steam forums. Please note that Steam does allow refund of 14 days as long as the game has been played less than 2 hours.\n-Game of the Year edition offers probably hundreds of hours of content for such a cheap price that no entertainment can even come close to this!\n[b]Thank you CD Projekt Red.\n10/10[/b]\n\n[b]Long Version:[/b]\nThe question is: Who do you prefer Yennifer or Triss?\nMy answer: neither! I prefer blondes!!!! Ciri where you at?\nJust a joke during COVID-19 pandemic hahaha\n\nImagine you come home during a pandemic where everywhere in India is under lock down (this includes Stores, Gyms and schools)\nYou can no longer see your friends and have to spend time in isolation.\nYou realize that things have gotten boring. You study all the day or work and do the same thing over and over again. You get tired of all the Netflix movies and think that gaming cannot offer anything exciting at all. You ponder when will Bethesda will release the next elder scroll? Enter Witcher 3 a game that rivals Skyrim and offers excitement during a season of COVID-19 pandemic and isolation.\nWell one that does not have to image as life has gotten sad during COVID-19.\nAfter studying for many hours or working for many hours, you reward your myself with one of the best RPG games.\nSeriously, I could not wait till end of the day to bust open Wicther 3 and Ignore my bosses calls at 8PM.\n\n[b]What is awesome about the game[/b]\n-The ladies of course!\n-Graphics are better than the \"vanilla Skyrim\"! Remember the dull Grey?\n-The love scenes haha\n-Tons of explorations. Do you want to rush the story or do side quests\n-Honestly, Skyrim made me so excited when it came out. There were so many places to explore. Witcher 3 has re-ignited that passion for gaming again!\n-You know that saying \"take the time to smell the roses?\" \n\n[spoiler]I would say take the time to explore Witcher 3[/spoiler]",

While writing this, i have 25hours played so far, and im far from end and yet i cant stress this enough: BUY IT and PLAY IT. Its worth every minute. Games like this are like a rare gem. Its pure, its done with love and done great!\n\nI liked the witcher one. The witcher 2 was kind of ok for me in terms of overall composure, but the 3 took what was bad about witcher 2, and it into a MADE GREAT GAME! Sure, if you are not familiar with the game, i advise you to look at few things.  \nHere they are:\nBestiary - use it, it helps you a lot\nGear - search, search, read and search\nCrafting - you can also make gear this way. Yes you can BUY gear, but its overpriced, and you will need money for repairs. Just do some activities, and you might find a blueprint for the gear, or find better one.\nAlchemy - basicaly, you make potion once, and when you Meditate, automaticly will be replenished if you have alcohol (special, not some beer lad), Oils, bombs <insert Link joke>.\nMonsters - eventualy you will find a monster, which is maybe 6lvl above you, and it seems it has infinte health. All you have to do, is go lvl up doing sidequests or main story line, and then come back.\nRecipes - some can be bought, some you must find yourself\n",

  "review": "This game saved my life.\n\nI am 29.\n\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you",

A game you will want to play over and over.\n \n  If you want to develop your fight strategy, this game provides the opportunity. There are books about monsters that you will fight and how you can beat them. By reading them, you can develop your strategy. But if you are a casual who does not want to develop their fighting strategy, you can grab a sword, and get to enjoy the story.\n\n  I don\u2019t like the mutation division.  It is bad that you have to give up some abilities for getting new ones. I guess it is made to encourage discovering new combinations, but I still don\u2019t like giving up.\n\nSome decisions in the story affect the story unpredictably. Sometimes it can be annoying, but isn\u2019t life like that too?",

  "review": "Now... before I say anything. I know what you are thinking. This guy played it for not even 10h? The fuck is wrong with that guy? \nWell the answer is pretty simple. I played the game offline.... and buy offline I mean without an internet connection... at all. That means that Steam didn't track my playtime. So, now that that is out of the way, onto the actual review.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vaPCGY0h.jpg\n\nMany people say that no game is perfect... and I usually agree with that.... except when it comes to this game. \nI have played this game for Hundreds of hours and I actually got all the achievements for it, so I am as close to 100% as you can get, and I think that I have seen everything this game has to offer. \nThe Story is the big one here. I won't talk about spoilers, so you can relax a little. I have read all the Witcher books, and this game captures the magic of them perfectly. This is fantasy, but without any of the bullshit that people dislike about fantasy. No Clich\u00e9s, No corny Dialog, no World saving Plot.... ok no they kinda got that one in there... but it isn't about that. It's about the people you meet. Ciri, Gerald, Yen, Triss, Lambert, Gaunter O'Dimm, Regis, Dandelion... I could go on for hours they all are like real people with motives and believable emotions. In every line of dialogue you can feel the love and care they put into all of this, and there isn't a single bad quest in this game. Sure there are some quests that boil down to kill the monster or get the thing. But like 97% of all the quest have an interesting spin on things and actually affect the world around you with branching storylines and so on. I'd even go as far and say that there are no real villains in this story, sure there are you typical bad guys, but they all have motives that you can sympathize with. The writing is the star of the show here, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry but most importantly, it will make you CARE! They nailed everything about the story, and you will be glued to your screen for the whole ride.  \nThe music in this game is something else. It fits the tone perfectly, and you will probably listen to it outside the game as well.... while you think about your Gwent addiction....\nThe beauty of this game can not be described, you simplay have to see it for youself and enjoy the artsyle and the landscapes.\nThe combat and the gameplay systems work really well all together, there is basically nothing more I can say about that. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it is unique enough to make the combat fun for hundreds of hours. \n\n\nSo that is it then.... we got everything covered... right? \nWell... where other games would take you money and give a little reskin and call it a DLC this game gives you a whole new game. New Stories (that are put together with as much care as the rest of the game and finish the story up with a beautiful touch), new gameplay elements, new great music, a ton of great Sidequests, new gear, and a HUGE new Open World. What more could you ask for?\nI actually don't know anything I could critique about this game... and that is kinda weird. I usually come out of a game and feel unhappy with something... but not here. I know it has become kind of a meme to say it... but this game is a Masterpiece. A 10 out of 10, the perfect game... what ever you want to call it. This is my favorite game of all time and I can only applaud CDPR for everything they did here. I know after Cyberpunk many people were upset, but if you look at this game alone.... I think they deserve a second chance... Hell as many chances as they want... as long as we get another game in this setting... maybe with Ciri as the protagonis... please? Pretty please!\nSo if you want your perception to change on what the best Game ever made is, and how you view games in gerneral get the Game of the Year edition and enjoy the ride.\nUntil then... Care for a round of Gwent?",

  "review": "I'm almost certainly shouting into a void of overwhelming adoration but it's a game that should be discussed for many years to come, even if the discussion is just to simply heap more praise onto it. \n\nI think I speak for many when I say that we are always looking for a game that feels as special as those that we played when we were children. An experience that captivates, inspires and keeps us yearning to return. For me, titles like the KOTOR series, Mass Effect trilogy and early Bethesda titles provided a world, cast of characters and sense of belonging that rose above the many hundreds of other games I have played over my near two decades of gaming. However, nothing and I mean nothing has come remotely close to the experience that the Witcher 3 provides. It sounds like hyperbole but it has such a special way of combining lore, questing, gameplay, exploration and reward with such finesse that it will almost certainly be looked upon as one of the greatest video games to have existed. \n\nI'm no expert on the intricacies of what makes individual parts of a game great but if you're perhaps on the fence over this titles then please, avoid spoilers and give this title a long, thorough playthrough. It has a way of enchanting you and not letting go over it's +100 hours. \n\nMy cynicism and expectations for video games has unfortunately grown as I've aged but I'll always hope to play a game than can give me this kind of feeling again. \n\nMagic.",

A lot of this is a buggy mess, and some crafting and upgrade systems are wonky as hell (not sure if I'm just bad, only played through once). Combat is okay though a tad repititous once mastered. Oddly my main gripe is that some of the NPCS have like 18 or 20 duplicates through the game, but are supposed to be different people. This highly ruined the emersion sometimes during the story. I'm very confused how they managed to include everything but more than 20 npc models when there's literally hundreds throughout the game. This is a choice based game that decides the ending, and I tried to choose the funniest shit, and I had an absolutely fantastic time. The drunken scene where they find Yennifers clothes is absolute gold, and is probably my favourite part of the entire game. God a shit ending, still extremely interesting though to see how my choices all lead up to how shitty of a person I am. Very cool. Fantasy staple with a couple major flaws. 9/10 revolutionary, especially the story.",

And the fact that choosing different dialogues leads to different consequences was so coool(Sometimes u try not to hurt NPC's feelings)\n\n\nGraphics and visuals:\nSimply mesmerizing, the atmosphere is great, and there are plenty of mods to use to make it even better.\nWith that being said I played the game on med-high and fell In love!\n\nGameplay:\nHuge improvement from the previous title, There are new attack animations new finishers etc... especially when u play as ciri UwU.\n\n\nDifficulty: I think its fair to say that battle difficulty is pretty challenging because with various types of enemies comes various approaches(spells,potions etc).\n\n\nSoundtracks: Sweet mother of baby jesus, the musics played at this game makes u reach the point called eargasm, dont believe me?

Also had Gwent card game ( with a lot of cards to collect but with rules less complex than the real Gwent game ), some romance, some sex, some theater play, herb and mats collecting. You can craft a lot of items, be it oils ( that you apply on swords to do extra damage to specific types of humans or monsters ) , potions, swords and armor. You can also eat or drink ( mostly your way to heal ), and on top of it all, you have 5 magic spells that you can level up and tweak, skilsl to level up, mutagens to apply, runes you can put in swords.. There's really A LOT here as you can see ( and I didn't even touch expansions yet ).\n\nThe story is mostly incredible with just a very few side-quests that a bit on the generic side. All in all , I give this game a 9.8/10. The only reason I can't give it a perfect score is that, espcially if you have expansions, there is so much to do, unless you are a completionist, you probably won't see what ALL the game as to offer...",

The world of the game is just incredible though I suggest you to read the books or watch the netflix show (or some youtube videos) first in order to understand the game better. It never bores you and you always have something to do, even the side quests are interesting and have good stories and the mini-game Gwent, what can I say about it its the most addictive card game.

The matches are short, fun, and addicting, and as a bonus, it also comes with a fun RPG minigame. Just watch out for that smurf in Vizima!",

  "review": "[h1]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/h1]\n\nI dont know how to word this better but i have never been so emotionally invested in a video game until i played The Witcher 3. It is unreal how attached i am to all of the characters. ([b]SPOILER[/b]) [spoiler]I managed to complete the game with, what people would say, a 'bad' ending. I felt so sad about what happened to Ciri that i had to load my previous save from The Isle of Mists and aim for the 'best' ending which had Gerald ended up with Triss (hehe)[/spoiler]. I have already started playing the first DLC and it has been pretty good so far. \n\nTo put it simply, The Witcher 3 is truly a masterpiece. It has a brilliant written storyline with a lot of amusing cutscenes. Its combat system, in my opinion, is one of the best out of many other games. The graphics is drop-dead gorgeous. I persistently find myself wandering around the map looking for some monsters to kill and sometimes i just like to stare at my swords cherishing how good they look. Another fun thing to do in this game is to play Gwent and build a good deck. Just get the game already if you haven't and feel the awesomeness yourself. This game is undoubtedly worth every coin and i highly recommend everyone to give it a shot.\n\n[h1]Rating: 11/10[/h1]",

  "review": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an adventure-RPG game, which is a sequel for the previous Witcher game. You playing as a witcher named Geralt, who want to find his lover, a sorceress name Yennefer and his adopter daugher, Ciri. However, things are not that easy and more and more deadly obsticales get into Geralt's adventure.\n\nI want to start with the story. Witcher 3 is affected by your choices from Witcher 2, which can change a few scenes or turn of events. Because of this, I was kinda worried about not knowing the previous games story and I won't understand anything, because this is my first Witcher game (yes, starting with the third game, even though I have the second and first on my account). But truth to be told, there were rarely moments when I should have known the character or place they mention from previous games, so this really didn't effected my playthrough. The game also gives you choices which can change the outcome of the situations. Truth to be told these choices are not really open or drastically most of the cases, but I wouldn't say these are useless. The main story of the game also interesting and I didn't felt it's too long, but if you played other story games, you might know what you will expect. What really good in the game, is the side quests and Witcher contracts stories. I'm not gonna lie, this game has more interesting side mission stories, than any other game. You get also choices here and it makes more these quest alive. The main game has a lot of exciting stories indeed and the game is really good at it, but I need to mention the two DLCs here, Heart of Stone and Blood and Wine. These both has a story line: Heart of Stone has one of the best story I have ever heard, but Blood and Wine also a really good one to play. So in this case, the game won't let you donw with it's story material, either we talk about the main game or DLCs.\n\nNext is the sound and music part of the software. Music is amazing in this game, there are a lot of tracks to listen to, they have this medieval feeling too. I really liked them, making the situation even more better. Other sound effects also mentionable, because works perfectly. Not over used or annoying, hell even better. Some sounds in caves or when you listen to the rain is really good. I liked it so much.\n\nTime to mention the game's controls. I'm not gonna lie, the game feels complex to control at first, but after you put into effort and time, you will get use to it. Not the most easiest control scheme I ever played with, but definetly works good enough. The game also perfectly works with controller too, and I think there are a few side missions, which require to aim freely, but at any part of the game, controller is a really good option to play this one. Controls works fine in Witcher 3.\n\nAbout the graphics, I need to say it looks amazing. This game is almost 6 years old and it really looks good. Characters, light and shadow effects, weather ingame and lot other it's just a joy to look at it. However, most of the times models goes through walls or through characters, sometimes the game can be hard to play with on higher graphics and it has some visual bugs. It didn't happen too often with me, but the graphics is not perfect, but definetly looks amazing.\n\nLast, but not least, the gameplay. What Witcher 3 really did good, for example the side quest and witcher contract system. It's not a new thing, but these missions are really fun to do, just like the main mission one. They are not boring and can give you a good amount of exposition or story for the game. Next is the amount of content. If there is any game, where players can do and go a lot in this game, that should be Witcher 3. You can really put into a lot of times checking treasures, clearing monster nests, clearing infested settlements or helping out people. The game has also a crafting system, not even mention the invetory system. If you had problems with the characters, or you forgot how to defeat certain monsters, the game give you a Character book and Bestiary too, which helps you out greatly. The game gives you multiple region to explore, so making advanture won't be an issue at all. However, the game is not that perfect in this one, because the combat system is really lacking. It's easy, even you play on harder difficulties. Leveling up system works interesting, because the game appraciate more if you do quests, then killing monsters, which makes the game not grindable. However, in my case, I was so overlevelled thanks to the DLCs, that I was level 52 when I started to do the final act of the game, making everything so easy and meaningless. Boss fights are fun at first, but after some time, those will get a little bit same. This is not true about the DLC figths. I had some annoying bugs, for example couldn't go faster with my horse, or I was overburdend, even though I had enough invetory space, but I was able to manage.\n\nI don't want to go too much into the game, but truth to be told, it's not perfect, but honestly... I played lot of game, and this is one of the best I've ever played. If you like story games or casualish RPG, than you will find this game perfect for you. I can definetly recommend to play this one, especially with DLCs. The main game for 30\u20ac even worth to get it, and +20\u20ac for the DLCs is a steal, really. \n\nI know the game is buggy, but still has a tons of positive things and content in it. One of the best, really.",

  "review": "TL;DR\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an open world, fantasy role playing game developed by the Polish team at CD Projekt Red. The player explores the massive world as Geralt of Rivia, or known to some as the White Wolf. Geralt is a Witcher, the equivalent of a bounty hunter but for dangerous monsters who terrorize civilization. Throughout the game, the player will take on contracts for these monsters, play the card game Gwent, have deep philosophical conversations with NPCs, and probably journey to the brothel once \"for a friend.\"\n\nRecommended For:\n\u2022 Readers of The Witcher books.\n\u2022 Fantasy lovers.\n\u2022 Wannabe bounty hunters that wish they got laid every time they slayed a beast.\n\u2022 People who like proving how \"alpha\" they are on hard mode.\n\nNot Recommended For:\n\u2022 Gamers who pretend they don't enjoy seeing Geralt's nude butt.\n\u2022 Horse haters. It'll be long walk.\n\u2022 Fans of Fortnite and Call Of Duty.\n\nVERDICT\nThis game is good enough to embrace the embarrassment of playing over 90 hours in the boots of Geralt. The combat is deep and asks the player to carefully consider how it approaches targets in a Witcher contract. Meditation and applying oils are always a good way to start hunting for a wraith. But maybe Geralt will also be asked to play a game of Gwent. There's plenty of time so make sure to collect all the Gwent cards so that if you can't beat the main game, you'll at least be able to beat everyone in Gwent. After the player plays some Gwent and finds the frying pan for the old lady, they can attempt to start completing the main quest while taking screenshots of the sunset behind the trees while riding Geralt's horse, Roach. \n\n10/10 Masterpiece\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt somehow creates a perfect storm of combat mechanics, storytelling telling, and visual presentation.",

I liked most of the characters some of which were Geralt, Ciri, Zoltan, and the rock trolls (purely for they're stupidity). The dialog options and different endings are nice too. Some things that i wish were added would be more romance options (longterm like Triss and Yen), transmogrify, and multiplayer.",

  "review": "Tried playing this a few years ago, couldn't get into it, refunded it. Then I played Cyberpunk 2077, and, aside from all the glitches, I really enjoyed it. So then I ventured back into the Witcher-verse (is that a thing?). Tried 1, really liked it, but it crashed so much that I literally couldn't progress. Watched a synopsis, then onto 2. Took me 18 hours, and I liked it. Solid 7.5 - 8/10. Then, I got to THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT.\n\nI really loved it! I thought, in terms of story, the main game was the strongest (solid 9.5/10), and the DLCs were great too. I didn't like Hearts of Stone or Blood and Wine quite as much as the main game, but they were still awesome. Unpopular opinion, but I think Hearts of Stone is slightly better than Blood and Wine. \n\nHearts of Stone was a solid 9/10 all the way through, and the ending was awesome (I got the good ending). Blood and Wine started as a solid 9/10, then the middle was kind of slow, but the last few hours were amazing, which evened it out. Both great DLCs though, and no question some of the best DLCs I've ever played (Outlast: Whistleblower, BioShock 2: Minerva's Den, and Spider-Man: The City That Never Sleeps ranking among them).\n\nI'm going to be sad saying goodbye to the Witcher-verse (please tell me if I sound like an idiot) for now, but I will definitely watch the show and probably do a New Game+ playthrough 6 months from now. Is this game as great as everyone says it is? Yes. And to think that 2 years ago when I picked up and quickly put down this game, I thought everyone else was crazy. Easily in my top 25 games ever.",

Bought the game to support the developers and show a gratitude of appreciation to the memories the game gave me. Played the shit out of it during lockdown. The story, the music and the setting suck you into a fantasy land melting all your worries away. \n\nBuy the game and play it if you haven't. You are in for a great adventure. Finish the main story, then visit the DLC that can put many AAA games' main campaigns to shame.\n\nWill surely revisit this sometime soon.",

  "review": "[h1] An amazing experience with minor setbacks. 8/10[/h1]\n\n[b] Witcher 3 [/b] is definitely one of the best games I have played so far. The immersion was satisfying and it got me hooked to the open world. On comparing with its prequel Witcher 2, Witcher 3 as a game is a revolutionary leap in every perspective from graphics, controls to the gameplay. A special mention is that you can jump and roam freely in witcher 3 and the map is so huge and breathtakingly beautiful. This game has so many places that worth taking a screenshot and I had stare at it for hours. But apart from all the reviews and praises that awarded to this masterpiece there are some moments or game features that felt unpolished or even useless considering the [b] game of the decade [/b] crown this game holds. \n\n\u2022 The level up and skill tree system is pretty primitive and over rewarding. \n\n\u2022 The difficulty is a joke. Even on the most hardest difficulty you can defeat opponents easily. The difficulty in Witcher 2 was much better. \n\n\u2022 Predictable gameplay and limited move sets for enemies.  The gameplay looks cool as compared to Witcher 2, but the fun looses when you gets an overall understanding.\n\n\u2022 Too many choices that had no impact on the game or just reach to a dead end. \n\n\u2022 Personally to me the game length was a little too much. I think the game could have been much better if they could made it smaller. Witcher 2 and a DLC for this game \"Hearts of stone\" was  perfect examples for small but best immersion. \nThey could have add similar DLC's like Hearts of stone instead to explore the large map instead of relying on a single main story. \n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\nApart from the above hiccups, Witcher 3 definitely was an immersive experience. The DLC's were amazing and well thought out and the world of Witcher 3 was the most beautiful one I have seen so far.",

  "review": "Though many of my friend have recommended this one for me I could not say the same to others. \n(1) Many choices in the dialogue seems meaningless. \n(2) The graphics seems too dark, for any scenes. I should believe this is some 'atmospheric' setting but such atmosphere is confusing when doing combat and making this game not an enjoyment but a continuous struggle to identify items, enemies and the background. \n(3) The combat system is a pitiful waste, if truth may be told. You seems only able to see exactly one enemy have their mark reddened to indicate their blow while actually there are multiple attacking. And the 'levels' of the enemies are quite misleading. You may well find some monster same level as yourself giving you a hard time while hacking off some monster way up the levels's head off easily enough.\n(4) The craft/alchemy system is tiresome. I should admit this is a common problem in nowadays RPG/Action games. You collect, you collect, and you collect, until you get your pocket overweight, and you sell or drop, not having a clear comprehension for which thing is for what crafting at all. For a clean Action Game gameplay, I would rather just have some easy 'money' system, and do some 'money = weapon' trade from merchants, like most Action games did back 10 years ago or so, thank you.\n",

  "review": "[h1][b]THE WITCHER 3 REVIEW:[/b][/h1]\n[b][i]A timeless masterpiece![/i][/b]\n\n\nThis game is CD Projekt Red at their finest. I've lost countless of hours replaying this game and each time I begin a new adventure there's always something new to find.\n\n\nIf you so decide to read through this wall of text that's coming, as a disclaimer I want you to know that this is my personal (and probably biased opinion). I know some players dislike this title some others love it and others are just indifferent to it. Nevertheless, I'm a huge fan of this game and the Witcher series in general.\n\n\nI'm going to start the review by describing the positives of this game:\n\n\n[h1][b][i]THE PROS:[/i][/b][/h1]\n\n\n[list]\n[*][b]The story: [/b]This game is basically the Witcher 1 and the Witcher 2 on steroids. It has a quality storyline with a lot of branching choices that will affect the world around you. There aren't any clear-cut options that you can choose and every action comes with its own consequences. You are in the boots of Geralt, the main protagonist, albeit, you are not a hero. You can't save everyone and you need to think about the actions you will take.\n[*][b]Exploration:[/b] This is an open world game which features two (3 if you own the expansions) huge continents with their own theme and style. There are a lot of nooks and crannies for the player to explore, lots of hidden well-written side-quests and treasures the player can find. Which brings me to the next positive:\n[*][b]Gear and customization:[/b] This game features a hefty amount of weapons and armors. Among the generic and the quest armor sets, there are also more unique armors the player can craft that suits their style of combat. The Witcher-school sets feature their own lore and storyline and they feel more personal once you craft and upgrade one of them. As for the main character, you can customize Geralt's hairstyle and beard. All in all, you will have lots of fun discovering new armors and tinkering with upgrades.\n[*][b]Replayability:[/b] One playthrough is simply not enough to experience what the game has to offer. The storyline is quite complex, there are a lot of side-quests that are easily missable and chances are, the more you play the more you will discover.\n[*][b]Gameplay and combat:[/b] The combat feels much more fluid than the previous games. It can be quite challenging for new players but also really rewarding. One of the best features are the Witcher contracts. These contracts are special monster bosses that the Witcher undertakes in exchange for gold. The fights during those battles are epic and depending on your level they can also prove challenging or even deadly. This game features a crafting and an alchemy system. You can find recipes for armors/potions by visiting different merchants or undertaking certain quests providing you with different options to personalise your experience.\n[*][b]Gwent:[/b] This is the main mini-game that this game has, hell, CDPR created a standalone version of this and it has been quite successful! You are definitely going to have a blast building your deck and challenging opponents during your journey.\n[*][b]Romance:[/b] There are two main romance options in this game. The characters are so well-made and so complex that it has caused a massive controversy over social platforms. Are you team Yen? Team Triss? For some this can be a tough choice, for others it can be a no-brainer. No matter what you choose, prepare to be amazed. [spoiler]Do not pick both, you have been warned![/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n\nI can keep going with the positives of this game but it would take forever. The graphics are top-notch, the environments, the atmosphere are also well made, the sounds, the music all the different effects... Overall, the attention to detail that CDPR put into this game is top-notch.\n\n\n[h1][b][i]THE CONS:[/i][/b][/h1]\n\n\nEven though I struggle to find anything negative, from an objective point of view, off the top of my head I can think of two things:\n\n\n[list]\n[*][b]The long-lasting story:[/b] This came to me as a surprise, but there are lots of people who didn't manage to finish the game and the main reason was this. The story lasting too long. I personally can't get enough of this game and I wouldn't mind it if the story was double the size of the current one.\n[*][b]The combat:[/b] This seems to be a hit or miss for some people, I personally enjoyed the combat through and through and didn't have any issues in my game whatsoever. But I can definitely see people getting annoyed over all those pirouettes and spinning animations.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1][b]CONCLUSION:[/b][/h1]\n\n\nWitcher 3 is an amazing game with a really good story and moral choices that will challenge your moral standing. You should give this game a try, it truly is a masterpiece and the best game CDPR has developed as of yet.",

It just makes character movement clunky and slow as hell.

  "review": "Let me clarify that words can not explain how IN LOVE I am with this game however let me give it a try.\n  Story: This game provides the closing chapter to the tale of the White Wolf. Even if you have not played 1 and 2 you can easily get hooked by the introduction chapter of this story and get immersed in the adventure. The characters are provided with a ton of fleshing out and you can do nothing but fall for them. This game has had me and most other people balling our eyes out or laughing to our heart's content at times. From Geralt hanging out with his mates and having a ton of fun like a damn schoolboy, to him having time to bond with his adoptive daughter and most controversialy to his romantic choices, the experience that is provided is nothing less than breathtaking. \nAlso in this game YOUR CHOICES MATTER. The endings are many and varied, based on the way you handled your quests (there are side quests in this that are better than the main story of lesser games). You might come at times at a crossroad and have to choose the lesser evil or you might have to ponder on whether to choose the happy ending or the best ending at the end of a storyline(play the game and you will understand).\nFinally, BUY THE EXPANSIONS. there is more quality content in there than most games will ever aspire to achieve!!!!\n  Gameplay: The gameplay does not get as much love as the story gets. However it is quite solid. You have your standard light and heavy attacks, signs that give you the edge over a normal human in combat, your potions that are a huge part of this franchise and oils which give you the edge when you are \"witchering\". Based on your preferences you can enjoy the story or have a dark souls experience and I think there is quite of a bit of depth here. Also one has to mention GWENT, THE BEST MINIGAME EVER. At times I even forgot I was playing a game within a game.\n Music and Environments: From the No Man's Land in Velen, to the City State of Novigrad, to the Island Archipelago of Skellige, the graphics are nothing less than breathtaking. I also think that the game is quite well optimised in order to run in lower speced PCs. The music direction in this did a solid job (as it did in the whole witcher trilogy). The transition from riding on Roach through the countryside and listening to calm tracks, when suddenly you get ambushed and \"Steel for Humans\" begins to play while you kill a few bandits is smooth and satisfying.\n\nOverall, as far as games are concered this is my GOAT and I can not recommend it highly enough. If you have a gaming pc and you have not played this one you are missing one of the greatest experiences of your life. And where this came from there is more. GET THE FRICKING EXPANSIONS. At the time of writing the whole package costs 50 bucks and there are no excuses. I felt that bad that I got the game at 50% that I paid full price for the expansions. \nTLDR: Finishing The Witcher 3 has robbed me of the enjoyment of playing games. Please help!",

(It has potential to be much better) But it's a masterpiece compared to previous games.\n[b] DIFFICULTY [/b]\nOn Normal it's too easy (if you use potions, blade oils and signs, It's ridiculously easy; you can kill a boss with few hits) and hardest difficulties become easy if you make an OP build with signs and alchemy.\nIf you overlevel doing sidequest which is very easy, underleveled quests give like 1 XP and you can one hit kill most enemies. (If you turn enemy level upscaling on you're gonna get fucked by rats)\nIf an enemy is above your level most will take forever to kill because they just absorb all damage (which is more annoying than difficult)\n[b] LOOT [/b]\nLooting is terrible and quest rewards are a big pile of horse shit! You get like a level 10 sword for completing a level 20 quest, it's bullshit. NPCs don't react to you looting all their shit in the house they live at, but overleveled guards will kick your ass if you loot a crate or something in their view.\nAt start you will probably use armor and weapons from bandits and chests but when you find witcher diagrams you will never use anything else because everything is shit.\nThe only gear that isn't shit in the base game is Witcher Gear and DLC Armor Sets.\n[b] MINIGAME [/b]\nThere is no more dice poker but now You'll get the addiction of playing all new Gwent which is a fun card game to say the least. [spoiler] (PLAY IT WITH EVERYBODY FOR DEM CARDS, GWENT IS THE TRUE GAME HERE!!) [/spoiler]\n[b] OST [/b]\nSoundtrack is 10/10, a pure slavic masterpiece and just like the game it's one of my favourite.\n[b] CONTENT [/b]\nIt's a big game and it's much, much longer than previous 2, there's a LOT of content whether it's Quests or Side Activities.\nQuests weren't boring to me and i did every one of them. Witcher Contracts are very fun though not very rewarding. As for side activities they aren't too boring until you get to Skellige...Fuck all them question marks.\n[b] ATMOSPHERE [/b]\nThey nailed it! Each area feels different; cold Skellige Isles, swampy Velen, Green Redenia with Oxenfurt city that has beautiful architecture and Novigrad both beautiful and dark at the same time.It even feels different depending where you are in the city: There's slums, docks, market area, nobles area and temple area, each feels vastly different with different people. It does a great job of making the world feel alive and breathing.\n[b] FREE DLC [/b]\nAlternative looks are OK but they don't fit in most situations (Triss' outfit being the least fitting)\nArmor sets look great and you can get better versions at higher levels (Skellige Armor looks amazing)\nQuests are good but Wolf School Gear should have been in the base game.\nBear and Hairstyle set and Finisher Animations should have been in base game, it feels like they put cut content as DLC (It's great that it's free)\n[b] BUGS [/b]\nThey were uncommon for me though they were a few, especially with Roach. They fixed most of them with patches.\n\n[b] CONCLUSION [/b]\n          9.7/10\n\nThose 0.3 being for combat mechanics and quest rewards/loot system.\nDespite that I recommend everyone to play it since it is one of the best games made.\n\nIf / When they make a sequel, they should make better Combat with more balanced difficulty and maybe not add a bunch of shitty loot that only serve you to sell for few coins, but actually add worthwhile swords and armor. The first game is good at this. (In Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine there are more useable armor sets and weapons outside of witcher gear so it's much better. It's sad because in base game there are some beautiful swords and armor that people will never use)\n\n[i] I'll write separate reviews for Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine [/i]\n\nI'm out!\n\nPS Fuck elves and the fucking Lodge of Sorceresses\n[spoiler] Drinking with Lambert and Eskel is the best quest in the game [/spoiler]\n[i] My writing skills are shit [/i]",

  "review": "I first played Witcher 3 a few years back and at that time my PC was not strong enough to support it so I had dropped it. I recently picked Witcher up again since I always liked open world games and from that point on I played it for hours at one sitting. The game is vast and has content for hours and I really liked one aspect of the GAME within GAME which was GWENT. Not like your regular mini games which we generally see in games. I was genuinely immersed in this card game which at first seemed incomprehensible but slowly but surely I was hooked on this gem. So back to the game one thing which I really liked was that it had a Rich Story. Your actions have massive impact on story and because of this you will always want to select the best outcomes. Even in secondary quests you will feel like if only there were a way to get a better ending and after looking up you find out that yup, there was actually a different way to go on about the quest.In the end I would say I really liked this game and I would replay it again some other time.

But every time I hear \"Best game that was ever created\" I get kinda pissed. Sadly, it's not. Story is cash, but it's not as good as Fallout 1 or Yakuza series. Combat is generic and doesn't feel all that special, Exploration is ass with too much shit on map, soundtrack is not mermable at all and overall i think this is actually overhyped game and I personally think that Yakuza series are much better series that Witcher series. And sidequest even if there were good ones, I still can't remember any of them. Sorry, but I really don't like Witcher 3. I acknowladge why is such a good game. But If I was in describe Witcher 3 in one word, it would be \"overhyped\". If you wanna play my personal Best Game of All Time, check Yakuza 0.\n\n8/10",

  "review": "fantastic world that you can lose yourself in, often find myself just taking in the view as i ride between locations. the moment to moment combat is relatively barebones but i can get behind the idea of preparing for each enemy with certain oils and potions to give yourself an easier time. quests have smart and satisfying writing to the point where i would have a good time discussing them with friends. paired with the fantastic writing is just the sheer scale of content, where you could find yourself playing for hundreds of hours and be able to still find more content",

The combat is engaging and it feels really good to swing your swords around in combination with your signs and potions to take on all kinds of monsters and people. This combined with the skill points and mutations, as well as glyphs and runes allow you to build your character to suit your playstyle. Then there is the story. There are so many great characters (some you'll love, some you'll hate): they are all really 3 dimensional and come together to bring the world to life. Not only is the main story brilliant, but all of the side quests and random people you meet along your journey have their own unique stories that you can engage with too. Sidequests aren't repetitive and add lots of new interesting features and mechanics to the game: not to mention awesome small storylines. A brilliant all-round experience: couldn't recommend more.",

I won't talk to much about the game because honestly I think it's most fun to discover the mechanics yourself and how they work. The world is incredibly immersive, and will grip you if you give it a chance.

It was a bit hard to get into at first because I knew it would be long and it had so much content, but once I got into it, I couldn\u2019t stop. One of the reasons it\u2019s so memorable is because of how much time you spend into this world. I got immerse in it just like with Skyrim years ago and it successfully scratch that Skyrim itch. The world is beautifully crafted, the graphics, the weather system and the atmosphere in general is so great. There's many beautiful towns with their citizens that can be nice or assholes, the wilds have lots of animals and a nice flora. A lot of great npc voiced by good actors, plus a good soundtrack. But all this wouldn\u2019t make this game what it is without its storytelling. Contrary to a lot of other open world RPG these days, the quests are more than just copy/paste. I remember playing the first two games and loving them, but this one is something else.",

  "review": "\u201cI know the contract said you\u2019d pay in gold, but don\u2019t you have a spare Gwent card somewhere?\u201d\n\nAlthough a bit difficult to talk about overall and also despite the fact that I recommend the game, I still think there is a great dealbreaker in this case. This is, if you care mostly about a good story, characters and world-building, you should consider whether to buy it or not. But, if you really need solid gameplay behind, I\u2019d say is an absolute no-go.\n\nI usually try to separate pros and cons, but I think this case demands a mixture.\n\n*** --- ***\n\nBack before I even tried the game out, I was kinda skeptical. I had actually played around 10h or so of the first Witcher. Considering that it was the first game of the series back in 2007, the clunky gameplay didn\u2019t hit that hard. So I thought that people were exaggerating a bit about it, cause it should\u2019ve built on that foundation after so many years, right? But no, now I rest assured that it is indeed not exaggeration.\n\nAnd it truly is a shame, cause as I\u2019ve said, if you are solely searching for a good story the game\u2019s great. But sometimes even that feels as a drag just because you know that at some point you are going to be thrown back into combat.\n\nFor instance you have these three bosses by the end. Most of them have been hyped throughout the whole game. They are quite intimidating, they aren\u2019t just hiding in some wee-castle al alone waiting for a fight, they leave the first mark on the scene when they appear. The pay out? A damage sponge that has two or three cycles of attack, may catch you off-guard the first two times or so, but that the last time feels as cheap as it gets. Melee techniques are reduced to two, but there is barely a difference. Magic abilities are like 5 and yet only one of them doesn\u2019t seem pointless. Potions, oils\u2026? I\u2019ve used a couple through the game, but that\u2019s it.\nAttacks connect depending on some kind of \u201crhythm\u201d. You may hit from 1 to 4 times or so then the enemy will (except for some minor ones) retort. It gets old really quickly. And again, turns mayor enemies and bosses into sponges that are there just to take a timesfold more damage. As feels go, it felt at the beginning that I was doing something wrong, but I came to realize eventually that this is how it is, it never feels good.\n\nTruly a shame and not only because of the story. I get the choice behind giving a limited amount of magic abilities. I\u2019ve praised Dishonored for doing so. And I still kinda appreciate it, even if most of the abilities were pointless by the end. While progressing, I shifted from maining one spell or the other, as I discovered how to use each one better. But again, truly a shame those choices and learning wouldn\u2019t matter by the end.\nI was impressed by the whole potion and oil business. But it\u2019s another thing that fell pointless. Gathering ingredients doesn\u2019t matter, because most of them can be bought (money stops being a problem after the introduction) or, if they are more unique, can be obtained during missions (tho this point I DO praise). The thing is that after you make them, there is no much use to them, at least not in the default difficulty mode. Increasing vitality? Increasing defense? Increasing damage? Sure, there are a lot, but they are merely stats modifiers, nothing interesting to unlock techniques or some sort of transformation (though I guess that probably goes against the lore somehow). Kinda the same thing goes for bombs. There are a couple with good effects, but ultimately pointless.\n\nThis problem obviously also affects the character progression. Truth to be told, here you do unlock some new and interesting techniques. But there is still lots of generic upgrades. Plus x percent to this, plus y percent to that. One thing is that you have to equip these upgrades in a sort of limited slots, which limits Geralt\u2019s power even in the long run, which is a great touch for post-game and higher difficulties.\n\nBut combat is not the most frustrating thing. Navigation is your true enemy.\n\nOut of combat, walking and running is \u2013mostly- fine. Swimming has a real problem in shallow water and in high seas (ironically). Diving is sometimes deactivated for no reason, like the control routine doesn\u2019t change, I\u2019ve fallen through the bottom of the map twice while in the sea, it\u2019s impossible to leave a boat when in combat on a boat, because you roll into the deck\u2026 And something else.\n\nI actually enjoyed exploring all the points of interest\u2026 Up to Skellige. Before that, they were quite interesting, there was some variety. But hitting Skellige all you find is chest in the middle of a boring, empty sea. This part really felt like a downgrade.\n\nBack to navigation, still out of combat, I think I\u2019ve found the worst equine companion of all games. Have you seen the beasts in Cyrodiil? Those bastards can climb up a 90 degrees slope. Roach tho? Well\u2026 I get that this world is not so much \u201chigh-fantasy\u201d bs, but come on. You can barely control it. Bastard will try to steer on its own some times, others, with no apparent consistency, will drive you into the woods. To stop on the first twig on his path, of course. Walking was hell, and yet I\u2019d usually take 15 minutes of that, if it meant not spending 2 on horseback.\n\nAnd in combat you don\u2019t really fight on horse most of the time. So it doesn\u2019t matter. But oh boy, the controls during combat. Trying to run away from low level enemies is a laugh, because you may sheathe the sword and start running, but Geralt will eventually just turn around and pull up a guard with his fists, screwing up your retreat. Not focusing on enemies doesn\u2019t seem to have much impact on the movement, as Geralt still faces the closes one. And attacks, luckily enough, are always fixed on the closest enemy. Here you can either dodge or roll. Both moves will give you invincibility time, no matter how it looks in-game. Sometimes tho, it feels like you lose control on the direction you dodge/roll, based on how the movement changes depending on the closest enemy. And dodging usually is safer, cause God, has rolling killed me too many times.\n\nSpeaking of which, Parrying and counter-attack. Just parrying became kinda pointless by the end of the game aswell. Most attacks break through your defense. Counter-attack is quite useful against humans in the first part of the game, but shows yet another miss in the combat system, and probably was the last straw for me to agree that combat is horrendous. No matter at which point of your animation attack you are or if you have your back turned to an attacking enemy, pressing the button to parry at any time when they attack you triggers a counter-attack, even if it has to be a \u201cghost\u201d one.\n\n*** --- ***\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the story is not always THAT good. And I repeat, I loved it. I haven\u2019t read the books, yet it\u2019s all well presented, the dialogues are great and it all feels right, even if you are not familiar with the novels (and I know that ain\u2019t always easy to manage). But, there is stuff that, because of how some cutscenes are acted out, is a bit disappointing or awkward. Especially when there is an object the characters are interacting with (Zoom-500%-to-face\u2026 GO).\n\nYet, all and all, even if combat doesn\u2019t really work, I somehow feel that a great effort was made with the game. It just lacked some polish and taking a couple better decisions regarding design. A bit repetitive and with pointless additions. Nothing really new, for the good or the bad. It\u2019s just that I feel like people should expect and receive a bit more from a game that receives such good praise (not all undeserved). And probably because I see why would they praise it, is why I try to look at it with a bit \u201charshly\u201d.\n\nAnd hey, points for making DLCs that are apparently another whole campaign, a good reason to come back some day to the game, maybe add the challenge of a more difficult mode and relive a great story. A great game as long as you know what you are looking for.",

  "review": "This by far my favourite game .\nGraphics: 10/10\nStory: 9/10\nCombat: 10/10\nWorld: 20/10\nCharacters: 11/10\nReplay value: 8/10\nThis game deserves the endless praise that it's getting , in my opinion The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt is the closest a game has ever come to a masterpiece . \nThe story is extremely interesting , it's very well written and it's fun in every past bit , sometimes they drag for way to long . In the simplest way this Witcher's story is a series of clich\u00e9s extremely well executed \nThe characters are outstanding , every SINGLE character is morally grey (even you, Geralt) . Every peasant is acting differently depending on the area you are (in Velen everyone talks with a certain dialect  like they don't know grammar , they don't and in Toussaint everyone is happy and speak in a \"poetic\" dialect).All the characters have a story to tell(biggest example:Bloody Baron), every choise you make matters in some way or another , so if you do the said thing the inhabitants of this village will treat you differently.All and all the characters are great.\n\nCombat , here is the tricky part . The combat has mixed opinions (sometimes people say it's too difficult or it's way too stail) , but they  don't understand that the Witcher 3 is a game of preparation, you will need to grind a bit for the oils ,potions , decotions, bombs , armor and swords it's (i hate to say this) \"realistic\".You can't just be said \"Go kill the [said monster]\" , you will need to locate it(using Witcher senses) , prepare the right stuff and then go kill it , you can't just storm the boss thinking that you will easily win(unless you are playing the easy modes).\n\nThe world of this game is outstanding. The attention to detail is amazing. Each area has the appropriate theme :\nVelen is full of poor people , it's sad , it's full of death and it's depressing , But that is the point of Velen it's No man's land that is ruled by bandits, killeres and thieves.\nNovigrad and oxenfurt are similar it's full of death , not this time by war but by torture , supremacy and tyranny. Skellige is a place of vikings divided by clans that are constantly fighting for the throne , so that's why every village is disconnected by another , the people there are strong , famed for their wrath so it is logical that they don't have or need the comforts of the continent. White orchard is a small little place that everything seems fine but it isn't, the villagers aren't happy that they have been conquered by Nilfgard , because they know ehat they are capable of , but they aren't warriors , they are farmers so they seem oppressed.Toussaint is  a place of \"pictures\" , a rose is similar to Toussaint , it looks beautiful and happy , but it isn't , the roots are painful and dark.\nSo i recommend to whoever reads this review to by this \"almost grandmasterpiece\" of a game",

  "review": "Possibly my favourite game of all time! The story feels bigger and more exciting as you progress, you have fun, quick little side quests, cool contracts where you defeat monsters, and very interesting side quests that were as intricate as main campaign quests. These intricate side quests assist the world building that make the main campaign more exciting.\n\nThe combat isn't too interesting, but can be enjoyable. There's definitely a few ways to make the combat kinda easy! But it is pretty enjoyable even when you feel like you're not doing what the game devs exactly wanted the player to do!\n\nMost appealing parts are: 1 - The RPG aspect, where you make decisions and see their consequences. It gives a lot of responsibility to the player and takes you into the world. And that brings me to the other most appealing part: 2 - The world within this game. The environment, the music, and the character and monster encounters you make immerse you in this world, and ain't that just a sign of a really good game??!! It sure is!\n\n9/10 - Great game!",

The graphics, story and fast paced combat are the best I've seen out of any open world game. The combat is definitely the best part. Just rolling around and hacking at a group of monsters is one of the coolest experiences and one you'll only get in a Witcher game. Not to mention the creativity that went into developing the bosses. Overall, if you like open world fantasy games, this is a must.",

The graphics, the game play, the  sounds EVERYTHING is top notch in this game. 100/10. Would buy again, definitely worth the price.",

  "review": "Played through the main game about a year after launch on PS4 and enjoyed it a lot. Came back for a second go because the Ultimate Edition was on sale and I never got a chance to touch basis with any of the DLC so I figured why not for the price. What saddened me to see was the game filled with graphical bugs. Thankfully not much at all has directly hindered gameplay, I can still run and play the game just fine, averaging about 100fps on high settings. But there are a lot of texture loading issues, sometimes I'll load the game up and it'll take noticeably longer to get everything up to par visually. Long enough where I'll literally just be playing the game with flat play doh looking textures until it all loads up. Terrain suffers from these same bugs, sometimes section of the road or grass will randomly just clip up out of the ground and start flashing. Things I shouldn't have to expect out of a 6 year old game that has had ample time to be cleaned up and especially after the games launch was already a little rough. These are really my biggest complaints which is why after this long hiatus of Witcher for me, it compelled me to write a review and at least talk about these things. I understand not everyone will have the same experience as me, and that's fair but this is my experience so that's all I can speak on. \n\nThe game is great though. Combat is fun and fulfilling, it inserts enough mechanics to not feel like a hack and slash but still keep the combat entertaining and not overbearing to learn. Graphics still hold up to this day although the face mocap is a bit wonky. I honestly couldn't tell you where face mocap was in 2015 so I can't honestly criticize too much for that at the time of this review. \n\nStory is riveting and will keep you engaged especially if you were already a fan of the fantasy rpg genre. Interesting characters and some pretty meaningful dialogue not just in the story altering options, but the game itself is generally written well all around. Side quests have a very high level of attention to detail in the story lines. Some branching off into multiple quests either solo or with another NPC you get to learn about along the way. (Do the Keira storyline)\n\nRPG mechanics are deep and thoughtful, alchemy and crafting will be your best friend especially at higher difficulty levels. Skill tree is deep but not overbearing, it strikes a great balance between being able to min/max builds if you want, or just throw points all over the place and still have fun. There are obviously optimal builds or what some would say are the best. But no matter how you play, you will have fun with this game. \n\nSo all in all, The Witcher 3 is a great game. Sadly as a consumer I cannot recommend it based off of my experience with the technical bugs. If you can get it on sale like I did for $10 and feel the value is worth fighting through the bugs, then sure. And for that price I'd say pick it up at least to have it, you can get it with all the DLC. But at full price I don't think its fair to sell a product that still functions like this even so long after launch. Most of the bugs didn't seem to be present until a little after the refund period ended and at that point I was already into the game again. If these issues become fixed, then I can highly recommend this game but not with the technical bugs it currently still has at this point.",

Been playing for 8 hours, and I've ONLY JUST NOW started really getting into the main campaign and traveling through different regions. I've spent more than 6+ hours in just THE FIRST REGION. That's how much content there is in this game. Yeah, I may not be the best at this game, but I can already tell that this is going to be one hell of an experience to enjoy.\n\n-Combat system is perfectly difficult to master, I know I haven't yet.\n-Enemies are complex and make you really feel like a Witcher when you learn how to eventually deal with them using past experiences. It comes naturally.\n-Open world is truly OPEN. I rarely use fast traveling, I mainly just ride on horseback to find loot and NPC interactions instead of just skipping over it instantly.\n-Graphics are stunning, even with a weaker sided processor.\n-Characters feel genuine and alive with real motives.\n-Story is long and intricate, from what I can tell.\n-You don't need much knowledge from the other 2 past Witcher games to have a good time.\n-You don't need to have much knowledge of this world in general to have a good experience, you'll learn in due time.\n\nGame has some obvious flaws, but, in all honesty, no real game changing or memorable cons I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nI'd give it a rating of a 19/20 from what I can tell so far, it's up to you to decide for yourself. Have fun, hope this helped!",

  "review": "Although I have not played much of this game yet, I can say without a doubt that this is a great game. The opening tutorial fit in quite well with the story, making it seem as though I really was training a child, where instead it was training me. From there, the open world is pretty much completely open right off the bat. There are some limitations as to how much of the map is accessible at the start, most of it is open. The graphics are pretty good. The graphics nowadays look a bit outdated compared to recent games as this game is now almost 6 years old. The writing is excellent so far, the story, while a bit hard to grasp at first as this is my first foray into the franchise, makes perfect sense. The controls are a bit hit and miss in my opinion and fares much better with a controller. The same goes for combat, while fun and not too repetitive, the combat system can be a bit clunky and feel like old school Diablo. The optimization of this port is amazing also. I run this at max settings, rendered in 4K, although downscaled to 108p as I only have a 1080p monitor, and I keep a very good 60 FPS all the time. I understand that my rig would have been a beast when this came out, but this is still well optimized. (I have an Intel i5 10400F, GTX 1660 Super, 16 Gigs DDR4 2666Mhz RAM) I do highly recommend this game, even when its at its full price of $39.99, and even the GOTY edition is a good deal, it may seem expensive, but give it time I picked up GOTY edition for 9.99 USD. I do give CDPR great praise for this game, although it may have had just as shady development as THAT game (You know the one) I still think this is a genuinely enjoyable game for the price.",

But until that point, and things that tied in at the end, pretty good.\n\nGameplay; god damn Ciri is so much fun to play as. I think the brief amount of time I enjoyed playing with her, I had way more fun than any other time with Gerald. Still, super fun, great mechanics and feels super fluid.\n\nEnding; idk if I did too many side quests before entering final stages of the game, but the last fights were far too easy. I am in no way a great gamer, I don't sit with dorito dust on my desk. But I still beat all final bosses easily in one go. Somehow the anticipation made it out as if they were going to be the biggest challenge of them all, and would be insane fights. Kinda dissapointing.\n\nGwent; god damn this was the most fun I had in this game. 10/10",

I think the in-game Gwent in Witcher 3 is better than the standalone version of Gwent, mainly because u can see the disappointment in your opponents face when u destroy them with a 300pt combo. For a game released more then 5 years ago, the visuals and gameplay are much better than most of the games released now. Can't wait for the next gen HDR updates.",

  "review": "I have  recently transitioned from comp FPS games to RPG games and there is something about this game that no other game seems to have capture. The game is very lively and despite CDPR's recent failures they still seem genuine and know how to put together a great immersive game. In a perfect world game devs from different companies would work together to create masterpieces but this is as close to a masterpiece as they come. However I just can't help but imagine/fantasize if CDPR did the story, the people who did Doom Eternal did optimization, and the people who did DMC 5 did movement and combat.",
